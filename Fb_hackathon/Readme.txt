In this project we have tried to make a voice assistant named “VoiShop” that
leverages the Wit.ai platform which will work as your personal assistant as well as
shopping assistant.
PERSONAL ASSISTANT:
This assistant will help you in all the day to day tasks.You just say it and the
assistant follows your command making your life a bit easier.Whether it is
opening youtube or playing songs offline or opening applications like notepad and
power point or searching the Wikipedia,just give it a command and its done,
eliminating all the steps that you were required to do these small
tasks.Moreover,if you are bored you can also have a random talk with your
personal assistant just for fun.Moreover,we have linked this voice assistant with
wit.ai ,so that the same command that you give to your assistant reflects on your
wit app also and we have given the various commands that our voice assistant
can understand some intents and entities.
We have used python and some built in libraries to make this assistant.
SHOPPING ASSISTANT:
This assistant will help you in opening amazon with just a command “open
myntra” and then you can browse and search products that you like without
typing anything in search tab.Moreover,you can also login to your amazon
account and add products to your cart without a single click.Our project is
restricted to only amazon and not generalised for all the shopping sites.We can
do a lot on the shopping sites but our project is restricted for some features only.
We have used web automation using python to accomplish this task and
integrated all this with wit.ai.
